# Defect-Life-Cycle

Crazy how one small issue can change everything in software testing. I once thought defects were just simple problems to be ignored. Someone told me— "Defects are just minor setbacks, don't overthink them."
And I believed them. I overlooked. I underestimated. I let complexity win.
Until one day, I understood the true journey of a defect - its life cycle that transforms from a simple report to a catalyst for improvement.
So, I started tracking every single defect with purpose. And guess what? Our software quality skyrocketed.
That's when I learned the real story of the Defect Life Cycle:

1. New: The defect is born, a raw observation waiting to be understood
2. Assigned: An expert takes ownership, giving the defect a purpose
3. Open: Investigation begins, peeling back layers of complexity
4. Fixed: The development team crafts a solution, transforming weakness into strength
5. Verified: Quality assurance validates the fix, ensuring true resolution
6. Closed: The defect completes its journey, leaving behind a stronger system

If you needed a sign to take every software issue seriously—this is it. Embrace the defect life cycle.
The Detailed Stages
1. **New**

First discovered
Initial report created
Waiting for initial assessment
No action taken yet

2. **Assigned**

Allocated to a specific team member
Responsibility is now clear
Initial triage begins
Severity and priority determined

3. **Open**

Active investigation
Root cause analysis
Detailed examination of the issue
Understanding the full impact

4. **Fixed**

Development team implements solution
Code changes are made
Preliminary testing by developer
Preparation for verification

5. **Verified**

Quality assurance team tests the fix
Confirms the original issue is resolved
Checks for any unintended consequences
Ensures complete resolution

6. **Closed**

Defect is completely resolved
Documentation updated
Final sign-off completed
Lessons learned documented

**Remember**: Every defect is an opportunity to make your software stronger, more resilient, and ultimately, better.
